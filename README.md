## 1. Analyzing US Economic Data and Building a Dashboard
Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. In this assignment, one will have to extract some essential economic indicators from some data, then display these economic indicators in a Dashboard. One can then share the dashboard via an URL.

Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period. GDP is an indicator of how well the economy is doing. A drop in GDP indicates the economy is producing less; similarly an increase in GDP suggests the economy is performing better. 

In this notebook, one will examine how changes in GDP impact the unemployment rate. 

## 2. Data Cleaning tutorial
Data cleaning is important to identify and remove errors & duplicate data, in order to create a reliable dataset. This improves the quality of the training data for analytics and enables accurate decision-making.

## 3. Clustering tutorial
The aims of this tutorial: -
- Explore sklearn - A popular python package that is used to build ML models
- Explore iris dataset
- Use supervised learning algorithm (KNN) to classify
- Use unsupervised learning algorithm (Kmeans) to do clustering

## 4. TensorBoard tutorial
Exploring interactive machine learning model dashboard that can be used to better understand and analyze the importance factors in which the model works, or for visualisations. 

## 5. Tic tac toe game
Practice python session where the aim is to create a Tic Tac Toe game.
